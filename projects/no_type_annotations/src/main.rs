// Data Types.
// Rust is statically typed language.
// which means that it must know the types of all vars at compile time.
/*
   DataTypes:
    - tells rust what kind of data is being specified.
    - two types:
          1. Scalar
          2. Compound
    - we neeed to add type annotation while converting from string to number using parse()
    - else rust compiler with display error.
*/

/*
 Scalar Types:
   - Represents single value
   - Primary scalar types:
       1. Integers -> should be unsigned integer (singed starts with `i` instead of `u`)


     // Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2e(n - 1)) to 2e(n - 1) - 1

     - `isize` & `usize`

     eg:
       - Number literals can also use `_` as a visual separator to make
       - the number easier to read, such as 1_000, which will have the same value as if you had specified 1000.
        1_000 == 1000


       2. Floating-point numbers



       3. Booleans
       4. Characters
